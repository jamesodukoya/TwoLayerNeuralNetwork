# Solving a Classification Problem with a Two-Layer Neural Network

In this project, I built a simple neural network with two layers and trained it to solve a classification problem.

**In general, the project covers the following:**

- Implementation of a neural network with two layers on a classification problem
- Forward propagation using matrix multiplication
- Backward propagation (optimizing the neural network parameters) using the gradient descent method
